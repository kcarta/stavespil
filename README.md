# Stavespil

This is a simple dotnet console app. It is the result of a single afternoon in 2023, where I attempted to make a dirty proof of concept for a Danish version of the [New York Times game "Spelling Bee"](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) that I was much enamored with at the time.

I can't remember where the word dictionary came from, without checking in detail I believe I took it from [DSN](https://dsn.dk/ordboeger/retskrivningsordbogen/ro-elektronisk-og-som-bog/)

Danish is a challenging language to make this style of word game with, given how short Danish words can be and the many forms that Danish words can have.
